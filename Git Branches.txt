
Branches and Merging


1. first checkout the project files from the github using "git clone"
	c:\users\desktop\$git clone <repository url>
	c:\users\desktop\ $git clone https://github.com/cubeiplKumar/masterrepo1.git


 2 : Create new branch
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\ $git branch “branch name” 
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git branch development


3 : Checkout  into new branch (i.e into development)
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git checkout “branch name” 
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git checkout development

	Now you will change to new branch , add some new files into the new branch.
	add the files, commit 
	-c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$touch new.txt
	-c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git add new.txt
	-c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git commit -m "added new file"
	-c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git push -u origin development
      (if you check it in github online, you will not see the new.txt file in the master repository)

4 :  Before merging the branch into master, checkout into master
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\$git checkout master
	Merge new branch in master branch 
	git merge “branch name” 
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\git merge development
	c:\user\desktop\masterrepo1\git push - u origin master

5 : Delete branch 
	$git branch -d “branch name”     		 — delete from local 
	$git branch -d development
	$git push origin - -delete “branch name”          — delete from remote 
	$git push origin - - delete development
